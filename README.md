To set up and run the Milestone Project, first make sure you have MAMP installed and running on your system. Open the MAMP control panel and start both the Apache Server and MySQL Server. The default port for MySQL on Windows is 3306, which should be used when configuring your database connection in the Spring Boot application. Open MySQL Workbench and connect to the local MySQL server using port 3306. Then, create a new SQL script and copy in the provided DDL commands to create the milestone_project database and its tables (users and books). After executing the script, verify the database and tables were created successfully. Next, open the project in your IDE (such as IntelliJ or Eclipse) and make sure your application.properties file matches your MAMP settings, including the database name, username, and password. Once the configuration is set, locate and run the main class MilestoneProjectApplication.java as a Spring Boot application. When the project runs successfully, open your browser and navigate to the local address (for example, http://localhost:8080) to test the registration and login features. This will confirm that the application is connected to the database and functioning correctly.
